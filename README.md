# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Error Handling and Robustness Improvements

To make the Elite Locker app more robust and resilient to errors, we've implemented several strategies:

### 1. Color System Fallbacks

We've created a comprehensive fallback color system in `utils/colorUtils.js` that provides safe access to colors with proper fallbacks. This prevents "Cannot read property of undefined" errors when the design system fails to load.

### 2. Date Formatting Without Dependencies

To eliminate dependency issues with date-fns, we've created a lightweight date formatting utility in `utils/dateUtils.js` that provides similar functionality without external dependencies.

### 3. Error Boundaries

We've added React Error Boundary components throughout the app to gracefully catch and handle errors without crashing the entire application.

### 4. Safe Component Wrappers

Components like `SafeAreaWrapper` now include robust error handling and fallbacks to prevent common issues such as "Cannot read property 'icon' of undefined".

### 5. Robust UI Components

We've created resilient UI components like `WorkoutCard`, `ProgramCard`, and `ClubCard` that:
- Use hardcoded styles to reduce dependencies on the design system
- Include proper type checking and defensive coding
- Handle missing or undefined data gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for images and other dynamic content

### 6. Startup Script

The `start.ps1` PowerShell script helps ensure all dependencies are properly installed and configured before starting the app.

### Usage Tips

1. Always use the Error Boundary component to wrap any code that might throw errors:

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <YourComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

2. Use the Safe Area Wrapper for proper rendering with device notches:

```tsx
<SafeAreaWrapper>
  <YourScreenContent />
</SafeAreaWrapper>
```

3. Use the color utilities to safely access design tokens:

```tsx
import { getColor } from '@/utils/colorUtils';

// Safe access with fallback
const backgroundColor = getColor('dark.background.card', '#1C1C1E');
```

4. Use the date utilities instead of date-fns:

```tsx
import { formatRelativeTime, formatDate } from '@/utils/dateUtils';

// Format relative time
const timeAgo = formatRelativeTime(new Date(2023, 5, 10));

// Format date
const formattedDate = formatDate(new Date(), 'medium');
```
